### Introduction
There are four types of monotonic stacks:
|  |  |  |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Strictly Increasing**  | Every element of the stack is strictly greater than the previous element.     | [1, 4, 5, 8, 9]        |
| **Non-Decreasing**       | Every element of the stack is greater than or equal to the previous element.  | [1, 4, 5, 5, 8, 9, 9]  |
| **Strictly Decreasing**  | Every element of the stack is strictly smaller than the previous element.     | [9, 8, 5, 4, 1]        |
| **Non-Increasing**       | Every element of the stack is smaller than or equal to the previous element.  | [9, 9, 8, 5, 5, 4, 1]  |
