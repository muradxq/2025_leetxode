## There are 10 patterns of problems:
  #### 1. Gray code
  ### 2. Checking is power of something eg -> 4
  ### 3. Question on the Basic Prop of XOR
  ### 4. Based On fact Seting Left most bit give You Large Number
  ### 5. DP + Bitmasks
  ### 6. Restricting Over some Operation e.g. -> + and - and / etc
  ### 7. We can Hash any string to bit mask
  ### 8. Decode XORed Array.
  ### 9. Generating submasks of a bitmask
  ### 10. Kth bits questions
