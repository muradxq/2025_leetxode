### References:
- [Solved all two pointers problems in 100 days!](https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/1688903/Solved-all-two-pointers-problems-in-100-days)

## There are four main categories of problems:
   ###  1. Running from both ends of an array   
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > The first type of problems are, having two pointers at left and right end of array, then moving them to the center while processing something with them.
